# Time-comparison
This is a small project comparing the time taken by different languages to complete a simple task of multiplication of two matrices of large size.I am comparing time by using these languages
<br>1. C<br>2. C++<br>3. Python<br>4. R<br>5. Matlab

---
### **1. What we will learn**
---
From this project we will learn that which language will take the least and which will take the longest time in performing a task.

---
### **2. Data used**
---
For this we use matrices of size starting from 100 to 2000 and the time is in seconds

---
### **5. Outcome**
---
Time comparison between different languages
<br>C > C++ > Python > R > Matlab
